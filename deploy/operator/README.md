# aap-operator (the chart)

The Helm chart of the operator of [§59a](../../docs/architecture/10-control-plane-and-crds.md#the-operator-chart): **one replica**
of the `operator` binary ([`bin/operator`](../../bin/operator/README.md)), which reconciles `AgentService` and `AgentConfig` in
**one namespace** and serves the agent registry. The CRDs are another chart, [`deploy/operator-crds`](../operator-crds/README.md)
(§93: a separate Argo CD app); the agents are custom resources of their own, in adam-rs's chart `deploy/coder-agent` and the
system chart (S11, S12), not here.

| Object | What |
|---|---|
| `Deployment aap-operator` | 1 replica, `Recreate`, no leader election (a second reconciler would only race the first). `operator run`, `WATCH_NAMESPACE` the watched namespace, probes `/healthz` (startup, liveness) and `/readyz` (readiness) on 8081, `/metrics` on 9090 |
| `ServiceAccount`, `Role`, `RoleBinding` | Namespaced, in the watched namespace. Exactly the rights below. **No right on Secrets**, no `ClusterRole` |
| `Service aap-operator-registry` | ClusterIP 8080, **only with a registry token**. No Ingress |
| `Service aap-operator-metrics` | ClusterIP 9090 |
| `NetworkPolicy aap-operator` | Ingress only from who the values name; egress only to the API server's ports |
| `ExternalSecret aap-operator-registry` | Only with `externalSecrets.enabled`: the registry token from AWS Secrets Manager |

## Install

```sh
helm template aap-operator-crds deploy/operator-crds | kubectl apply --server-side -f -     # once, and on a change of a type
helm upgrade --install aap-operator deploy/operator --namespace another-agentic-system \
  -f deploy/operator/examples/netcup.values.yaml
```

On netcup an Argo CD Application does this (`helm.valuesObject`, the contents of
[`examples/netcup.values.yaml`](examples/netcup.values.yaml)), and CI bumps `image.tag` ([below](#the-image)). The image tag is
`sha-0000000` until the first build of `main` bumps it: **a render of the chart before that deploys an image that does not exist**.

## Values

| Value | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `image.repository`, `image.tag`, `image.digest`, `image.pullPolicy` | `ghcr.io/vymalo/another-agentic-platform/operator`, `sha-0000000`, none, `IfNotPresent` | The tag is **written by CI only** (`bump-tag.sh`), never by hand. `latest` and a malformed digest are refused |
| `imagePullSecrets` | `[]` | For a private package ([below](#the-image)) |
| `watchNamespace` | the release's namespace | The one namespace watched; the `Role` and `RoleBinding` are made there. A name, never a list or a wildcard: **there is no value that gives the operator a `ClusterRole`** |
| `storeCnpg` | `true` | The right on CloudNativePG `Cluster`s (`get patch create delete`). The image is built with the `store-cnpg` feature; `false` is for a cluster that has no CloudNativePG |
| `registry.tokenSecret.name`, `.key` | none, `token` | An existing Secret that holds the registry's bearer token. The operator reads the file **once**, at start: after a rotation, restart the pod |
| `registry.publicUrl` | none | `REGISTRY_PUBLIC_URL`: the registry document's own URL, its `anchor` |
| `externalSecrets.enabled`, `.apiVersion`, `.refreshInterval`, `.secretStoreRef`, `.key`, `.properties.registryToken` | off, `external-secrets.io/v1`, `1h`, `ClusterSecretStore/ssegning-aws`, `prod/another-agentic/env`, `agent_registry_token` | The token from AWS Secrets Manager, as in the system chart: one ExternalSecret, one property. Not together with `registry.tokenSecret.name` |
| `networkPolicy.enabled` | `true` | |
| `networkPolicy.registry.allowFrom` | `[]` | NetworkPolicyPeers that may read the registry. **Required while there is a token and a policy**: an empty list would make the registry unreachable, which the chart refuses. A peer with only a `podSelector` means the pods of the watched namespace |
| `networkPolicy.metrics.allowFrom` | `[]` | Who may scrape `/metrics`. Empty: nobody |
| `networkPolicy.apiServer.ports`, `.cidrs` | `[443, 6443]`, `[]` | The API server as the pod reaches it (the Service is 443, most clusters' endpoint 6443). `cidrs`, from `kubectl get endpoints kubernetes`, narrows it to those addresses |
| `logLevel` | `info` | `RUST_LOG` |
| `tuning.concurrency`, `.resyncSecs`, `.resyncPendingSecs` | unset (the binary's 4, 300, 15) | `AAP_CONCURRENCY`, `AAP_RESYNC_SECS`, `AAP_RESYNC_PENDING_SECS`; another key is refused |
| `resources` | 50m / 64Mi requested, 256Mi limit | |
| `serviceAccount.create`, `.name`, `.annotations` | `true`, the fullname, none | |
| `podAnnotations`, `podLabels`, `priorityClassName`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `affinity` | empty | |

**There is no `replicaCount`** (a value of that name is refused), no `crds.install` (§59a listed one before §93 decided on a
separate app) and no `values.schema.json`: neither of the sibling charts, `deploy/coder` and `deploy/chart` of
another-agentic-system, has one; [`templates/_validate.tpl`](templates/_validate.tpl) refuses what would deploy something other
than what the values say.

The pod is `runAsNonRoot` (65532, the image's user), `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`,
every capability dropped and a read-only root filesystem (the binary writes no file). It mounts the service account token, which is
how it reaches the API.

## Rights

The `Role` is the sum of the three crates' tables, no more
([controller](../../crates/controller/README.md#cluster-rights), [runtime](../../crates/runtime-kubernetes/README.md#cluster-rights),
[store](../../crates/store-cnpg/README.md#cluster-rights)); `tests/render-check.sh` compares it with this table line by line.

| Resources | Verbs |
|---|---|
| `agentservices`, `agentconfigs` (`agents.vymalo.com`) | `get list watch patch` |
| `agentservices/status`, `agentconfigs/status` | `patch` |
| `events` (`events.k8s.io`) | `create patch` |
| `statefulsets`, `deployments` (`apps`) | `get list watch patch create delete` |
| `services`, `configmaps`, `persistentvolumeclaims` | `get list patch create delete` |
| `networkpolicies` (`networking.k8s.io`), `poddisruptionbudgets` (`policy`) | `get list patch create delete` |
| `pods` | `list watch` |
| `clusters` (`postgresql.cnpg.io`), with `storeCnpg` | `get patch create delete` |

**No right on Secrets** (a Secret an agent names is read by the kubelet; the operator never sees a value), none on
`agentservices/finalizers`, none on `databases`, `poolers` or `clusters/status`, and nothing outside the watched namespace.

## The registry and its token

`operator run` serves the registry only with a token, and the chart follows: **no `registry.tokenSecret.name` and no
`externalSecrets.enabled` means no `REGISTRY_TOKEN_FILE`, no port 8080, no registry Service**, and every service says `Listed: False`,
reason `RegistryDisabled` ([`bin/operator`](../../bin/operator/README.md)). The token reaches the pod as a file, `/var/run/secrets/aap/registry/token`
(mode 0440, group 65532), never as an environment variable.

On netcup the token is the AWS property **`agent_registry_token`** of `prod/another-agentic/env`: random, at least 32 bytes
(`openssl rand -hex 32`). The system chart (S12) reads the same property as its orchestrator's `AGENT_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, so the two sides
cannot differ. It is **not** the agents' bearer (`AGENT_REGISTRY_AGENT_TOKEN`, a member of each agent's `A2A_BEARER_TOKENS`: the
agent token rule of §59a).

## The image

`ghcr.io/vymalo/another-agentic-platform/operator`, built from [`docker/operator/Dockerfile`](../../docker/operator/Dockerfile) by
[`operator-image.yml`](../../.github/workflows/operator-image.yml): on a pull request it builds, smoke-tests and runs the kind
end-to-end of the coder; on `main`, after those pass, it pushes the image **that passed** as `sha-<7>`, and as `latest`
unless main has moved on to a newer build (image jobs can finish out of order), and a last job
runs `bump-tag.sh` and pushes `chore(deploy): bump operator to sha-<7>` to `main` as `github-actions[bot]` (§93 allows it). A
deployment pins `sha-<7>`, never `latest`.

**A new GHCR package is private until it is made public.** After the first push (owner step): *Packages → operator → Package
settings → Change visibility → Public*, then check the anonymous pull, from the images repository's `CLAUDE.md`:

```sh
TOKEN=$(curl -s "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:vymalo/another-agentic-platform/operator:pull" | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json, application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json, application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json' \
  https://ghcr.io/v2/vymalo/another-agentic-platform/operator/manifests/sha-<7>      # 200
```

Until it answers 200, a cluster that pulls it anonymously gets `ImagePullBackOff` (or set `imagePullSecrets`).

## Tests

```sh
helm lint deploy/operator && helm lint deploy/operator-crds
sh deploy/operator/tests/render-check.sh                    # needs helm
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 sh deploy/operator/tests/render-check.sh    # after a deliberate change: rewrites tests/golden
sh deploy/operator/tests/bump-tag-test.sh
```

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `tests/render-check.sh` | the three golden renders (`tests/golden/netcup.yaml` from `examples/netcup.values.yaml`, `secret.yaml` from `tests/secret.values.yaml`, `default.yaml`); no Secret object, no `ClusterRole`, no host access; one replica, `Recreate`, the probes, the security context; the `Role` equal to the table above, with and without `storeCnpg`; the registry only with a token, mounted as a file; the NetworkPolicy; the ExternalSecret; every refusal of `_validate.tpl`; and `deploy/operator-crds` equal to `deploy/crds` |
| `tests/bump-tag-test.sh` | `bump-tag.sh` edits only `image.tag`, is idempotent, refuses a malformed tag (the test of adam-rs's `deploy/coder`, with this chart's values) |
| `tests/schemas/` | the `ExternalSecret` schema for kubeconform ([its README](tests/schemas/README.md)) |
| `tests/e2e/` | the kind end-to-end of the coder (S9): [`tests/e2e/README.md`](tests/e2e/README.md) |

CI also runs kubeconform in strict mode over four renders (the defaults, netcup, `secret.values.yaml`, and the CRDs chart with the
`CustomResourceDefinition` kind skipped, because the schema set has none: the `kind` job of `operator.yml` applies them to a real API server).

## What is not proven

* The chart has been rendered, linted and checked with kubeconform; **it has not been installed on a cluster by hand**. The first
  install is the `operator-coder-e2e` job of `operator-image.yml` (*unverified* until CI has run it), which installs this chart
  into kind and runs the real coder under it. In particular *unverified*: that a read-only root filesystem is enough for the
  binary, that the NetworkPolicy's egress is enough on a cluster that enforces it (kind's does), and that `list` without `watch` on
  `services`, `configmaps` and `persistentvolumeclaims`, as the runtime README lists them, is what the provider needs.
* That Argo CD syncs the CRDs of `deploy/operator-crds` and this chart in that order (its sync waves, or two Applications) and leaves
  an agent's objects alone while it does.
