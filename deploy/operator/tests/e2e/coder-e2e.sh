# The kind end-to-end of the coder (S9): the operator, installed from its chart, runs the REAL adam-rs coder image.
#
#   sh deploy/operator/tests/e2e/coder-e2e.sh        (from the repository root, kubectl pointed at a kind cluster)
#
# What it does, in order, and asserts as it goes:
#   1. the CRDs (deploy/operator-crds, server-side, as Argo CD does) and a Postgres, dummy Secrets for the coder;
#   2. the operator chart, with the image of the job (OPERATOR_IMAGE_*): the operator is Ready, runs as 65532 and its
#      service account may do what its Role says and nothing else (`kubectl auth can-i`);
#   3. examples/coder.yaml as adapted in coder.yaml: the AgentService becomes Ready, the coder pod is Ready, its agent card
#      answers through the Service (from a pod), its JSON-RPC endpoint refuses a request with no token, and the registry
#      lists it, with the token (a pod that may not read the registry is refused, when the cluster enforces NetworkPolicies);
#   4. the AgentService is deleted: the finalizer completes, the StatefulSet and Service go, and the claim stays (Retain).
#
# What it does NOT prove: no model (MODEL_BASE_URL is never called), no GitHub (a dummy token, and the GitHub MCP server of the
# pod is only asked for its tool list, which makes no request to GitHub), no task is sent to the coder, no GitHub App.
#
# Needs kubectl, helm, jq, openssl and a cluster that has the operator image already (kind load docker-image). Every step is
# bounded; on a failure the cluster's state is printed.
#
# OPERATOR_IMAGE_REPOSITORY (default operator), OPERATOR_IMAGE_TAG (default smoke) and OPERATOR_PULL_POLICY (default Never)
# say which image the chart runs: the one loaded into kind, never one pulled.
