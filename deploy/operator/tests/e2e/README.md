# The kind end-to-end of the coder (S9)

The operator, installed from its chart, runs **the real adam-rs coder image** in a kind cluster. This is the job
`operator-coder-e2e` of [`.github/workflows/operator-image.yml`](../../../../.github/workflows/operator-image.yml); the script
[`coder-e2e.sh`](coder-e2e.sh) is all of it and runs against any kind cluster that has the operator image:

```sh
docker build -t operator:smoke -f docker/operator/Dockerfile . && kind load docker-image operator:smoke --name <cluster>
sh deploy/operator/tests/e2e/coder-e2e.sh        # kubectl on that cluster; needs helm, jq and openssl; pulls a 2.9 GB image
```

    participant J as coder-e2e.sh
    participant K as kind (API server, kubelet)
    participant O as operator (the chart's image)
    participant C as coder pod (the real image)
    participant P as Postgres (postgres.yaml)

    J->>K: the CRDs (deploy/operator-crds, server-side), Postgres, Secrets with dummy values
    J->>K: helm upgrade --install deploy/operator (the image loaded into kind, pullPolicy Never)
    K-->>J: the operator is Ready, as 65532, and auth can-i as its service account says what its Role allows
    J->>K: coder.yaml: AgentConfig, then AgentService
    O->>K: watches both, adds the finalizer, server-side applies the StatefulSet, Service, ConfigMap, NetworkPolicy
    K->>C: the kubelet pulls the image and starts the GitHub MCP sidecar, then the coder
    C->>P: connects and migrates (DATABASE_URL from the Secret)
    O->>K: status.state Ready, endpoints, Listed
    J->>C: from a pod: the card (public), POST / with no token (401) and with the Secret's token
    J->>O: from a pod: the registry with the token (lists the coder) and without (401)
    J->>K: delete the AgentService
    O->>K: deletes the workload (Retain keeps the claim), removes the finalizer
    K-->>J: the AgentService is gone, the claim work-coder-0 stays with no owner

    [*] --> Installed: CRDs, Postgres, Secrets, the operator chart
    Installed --> Applied: kubectl apply coder.yaml
    Applied --> Ready: the pod pulled and started (status.state Ready, at most 25 minutes)
    Applied --> Failed: Blocked for 30 s, or the time is up
    Ready --> Asked: the card, the A2A endpoint's 401, the registry
    Asked --> Deleted: kubectl delete agentservice coder
    Deleted --> [*]: the finalizer completed, the claim stays (Retain)
    Failed --> [*]: the script prints what the cluster says

## What it proves

* The chart installs on a real cluster: the operator is Ready (`/readyz`), runs as 65532 on a read-only root filesystem, and its service
  account may do what its `Role` says and nothing else: no Secrets, no `agentservices/finalizers`, nothing cluster-wide, nothing in another
  namespace (`kubectl auth can-i`, as the service account).
* The operator makes a workload from `AgentConfig` and `AgentService` that **the real coder starts in**: with the GitHub MCP
  server as a native sidecar of the same image, a Postgres it migrates, and the variables the operator derived. The coder exits 78 on a
  configuration it does not accept and 69 when a dependency is down, so a Ready pod is the startup checks of `bin/adam-coder` passed.
* `status.state` is `Ready`, with `ConfigResolved`, `StoreReady`, `RuntimeReady` and `Ready` True and `Listed: Listed`, and
  `status.endpoints` are what the pod serves.
* The A2A card answers through the Service, from another pod, and names the Coder and its `coding-task` skill; the JSON-RPC
  endpoint is closed without the token and with a wrong one, and the token of the Secret is not refused (the Secret reached the pod).
* The registry, read from a pod with the token, lists the coder with its card URL, title and tags, and the card it lists is the card
  the pod serves; without the token it answers 401. A pod the registry's NetworkPolicy does not name is refused, when the cluster
  enforces NetworkPolicies (otherwise the job says so, in a warning, and does not fail: that is the CNI's, not the operator's).
* Deleting the `AgentService` completes its finalizer, removes the StatefulSet, the Service and the pod, **keeps the claim `work-coder-0` with
  no owner** (`deletionPolicy: Retain`) and the `AgentConfig`, and the registry lists nothing.

## What it does not prove

* **No model.** `MODEL_BASE_URL` is `http://model.invalid/v1`: the coder opens no connection to its model at startup (*verified by reading only, 2026-10-05*: a search of `bin/adam-coder/src`, `crates/adam-service/src` and the model crates
  of adam-rs at `588e9b5`, one commit past the image's `9a1fd4e`, finds no model call at startup), and no task is sent, so nothing ever asks it.
* **No GitHub.** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a dummy and the GitHub App variant is not run (a real key would be a real credential): the GitHub MCP server
  of the pod is only asked for its tool list, which makes no request to GitHub (*verified 2026-10-03* by adam-rs). No clone, branch, push or pull request.
* **No run.** No A2A task reaches the coder: no journal, lease, worker or tool is exercised beyond startup. That the operator's variables make
  the coder *work* is the parity goldens' claim (`crates/domain/tests/golden`), not this job's.
* **Not the netcup coder**: one worker, 1 GiB of storage on kind's default class, no web search, no Context7, no CloudNativePG (a
  Postgres pod instead; CloudNativePG is `store-cnpg`'s job), the combined topology only (not `split`), and no cutover from the Helm chart (M3).
* The image of adam-rs is the one of `main` on 2026-10-05 and is not tracked: a bump of the pin is a deliberate change of `coder.yaml`,
  with the digest of the tag read from ghcr.io again (`adam-upgrade`, `bump-adam`).

*Unverified* until the job has run: all of the above has been checked here only as far as `shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `helm` and the
`cargo test` of `e2e_fixture.rs` can reach; no cluster, no docker daemon and no kubelet existed where the job was written. Where it
may need a fix: the size of the coder image on a runner's disk (the job frees about 25 GB first), the time of the first pull (25
minutes allowed), kindnet's handling of the operator's egress policy, whether a POST of `{}` to the JSON-RPC endpoint with the right
token is answered with something other than 401 or 403, and `busybox`-free tools: the script asks from `curlimages/curl`, pinned by digest.
