//! The reconcilers of the v0 operator (§59a, "Reconciliation"): kube-rs controllers for
//! `AgentService` and `AgentConfig`, generic over [`aap_ports::RuntimeProvider`] and
//! [`aap_ports::StoreProvisioner`] (AD-020).
//!
//! * [`Operator`] wires the two controllers to their triggers and runs them.
//! * [`reconcile_service`] and [`reconcile_config`] are one pass each, public so that a test can drive
//!   them against the `Memory` providers and a fake API server.
//! * [`derive`](mod@derive) is the pure part: what a pass saw, as conditions and a state.
//! * [`ReflectorDirectory`] is the [`aap_ports::AgentDirectory`] the registry (S7) will read.
//!
//! No Kubernetes type is in a port's signature: `kube` appears here, in the controller, which is
//! its job. The provider-specific owner reference travels as an opaque handle the composition root
//! knows how to make ([`OwnerOf`]).
