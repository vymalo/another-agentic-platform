//! `StoreProvisioner` for a referenced Secret (§59a, "Secrets and databases", AD-024).
//!
//! A service whose `store.postgres.secretRef` names a Secret key needs nothing made: someone else
//! owns the Secret and the database behind it. This provisioner checks the reference is well formed
//! and reports it, so the controller can say `StoreReady: SecretReferenced` and `aap-domain` can
//! hand the same reference to the pod as `DATABASE_URL`.
//!
//! **It never reads a Secret, and it has no client of any kind.** The operator has no right on
//! Secrets (AD-024: a `get` returns the values, and a `list` of keys does not exist), so whether the
//! Secret and its key exist is the kubelet's to say: a pod that references a missing one stays in
//! `CreateContainerConfigError`, which the runtime provider reports as the issue `MissingSecret` and
//! the controller as `RuntimeReady: False`, reason `MissingSecret`. That is why [`StoreState`] has
//! `SecretReferenced` and not a `SecretFound`.
//!
//! A cluster kind is refused as [`StoreError::Unsupported`]: it is `store-cnpg`'s (S6).
